# Upcoming Calendar Events

A WordPress plugin that displays upcoming events from a Google Calendar on the front-end of any WordPress site.

---

## Features

- **Shortcode** `[upcoming_events]` renders the next N upcoming events on any page or post
- **Settings page** under *Settings → Calendar Events* for API key, cache duration, and default event count
- **WP Transient caching** to avoid hitting Google's rate limits on every page load
- **AJAX rendering** — events load asynchronously so page caches (Varnish, WP Super Cache, etc.) don't interfere
- **Manual cache flush** button in the admin settings page
- Clean, semantic HTML output with minimal default styling
- Graceful error handling — shows friendly messages on network failures, bad keys, and empty results
- No events? No breakage.

---

## Requirements

- **WordPress** 6.0 or later
- **PHP** 8.0 or later
- A **Google Cloud project** with the Calendar API enabled (free tier is sufficient for most sites)

---

## Installation

### 1. Upload the plugin

**Option A — Composer (recommended)**

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/your-username/upcoming-calendar-events.git
cd upcoming-calendar-events
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

**Option B — Manual (no Composer)**

Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/`. The plugin includes a fallback PSR-4 autoloader that runs automatically when `vendor/autoload.php` is absent.

### 2. Activate the plugin

Go to *Plugins → Installed Plugins* and activate **Upcoming Calendar Events**.

## Obtaining a Google API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one).
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Library**.
4. Search for **Google Calendar API** and click **Enable**.
5. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
6. Click **Create Credentials → API key**.
7. (Recommended) Click **Restrict Key**:
   - Under *API restrictions*, select **Google Calendar API**.
   - Under *Application restrictions*, add your site's domain.
8. Copy the API key.

## Finding Your Google Calendar ID

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
2. In the left sidebar, hover over the calendar you want to share, then click the three-dot menu → **Settings and sharing**.
3. Scroll down to **Integrate calendar**.
4. Copy the **Calendar ID** (looks like `name@group.calendar.google.com` or `abc123xyz@google.com`).
5. Ensure the calendar's **Access permissions** are set to *Make available to public* (or at least accessible by the API key's project) — otherwise the API will return a 403.

## Plugin Configuration

Go to **Settings → Calendar Events** in your WordPress admin:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Google API Key | *(empty)* | Your Google Cloud API key |
| Cache Duration | 60 minutes | How long to cache API responses (1–1440 minutes) |
| Default Number of Events | 5 | Fallback `count` when shortcode omits it |

Click **Save and Validate** — the plugin makes a lightweight test request to confirm the API key is working.

## Shortcode Reference

```
[upcoming_events
    count="10"
    days_ahead="30"
    show_description="true"
    google_calendar_id="your-calendar@group.calendar.google.com"]
```

| Attribute | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google_calendar_id` | **Yes** | — | The Google Calendar ID |
| `days_ahead` | **Yes** | — | How many days ahead to search for events |
| `count` | No | Settings value | Maximum events to display |
| `show_description` | No | `false` | Whether to show event descriptions |

### Examples

Show the next 5 events in the next 30 days:
```
[upcoming_events days_ahead="30" google_calendar_id="abc@group.calendar.google.com"]
```

Show 10 events with descriptions:
```
[upcoming_events count="10" days_ahead="60" show_description="true" google_calendar_id="abc@group.calendar.google.com"]
```

## Theming & Styling

All front-end classes follow a `uce-` prefix and BEM-like structure:

```
.uce-events-wrapper          — outer container
.uce-events-list             — <ol> list
.uce-event                   — individual <li>
.uce-event--all-day          — modifier for all-day events
.uce-event__title            — event heading
.uce-event__meta             — date/time wrapper
.uce-event__start            — <time> for start
.uce-event__end              — <time> for end
.uce-event__location         — location string
.uce-event__description      — description block
.uce-loading                 — AJAX loading state
.uce-error                   — error message
.uce-no-events               — empty-state message
```

Override any of these in your theme's `style.css` to customise the appearance.

## Architecture Decisions

### Object-Oriented + PSR-4

The codebase is split into four namespaced subsystems under `src/`:

```
src/
├── Plugin.php               — bootstraps everything, registers hooks
├── Admin/
│   └── SettingsPage.php     — settings page UI, form handling, validation
├── API/
│   ├── GoogleCalendarClient.php  — HTTP wrapper around the Google API
│   └── EventFetcher.php          — orchestrates API + cache
├── Cache/
│   └── TransientCache.php   — WP Transient abstraction with a flush registry
└── Frontend/
    ├── Shortcode.php        — [upcoming_events] shortcode registration
    └── AjaxHandler.php      — wp_ajax_* handler; renders event HTML
```

Each class has a single responsibility and depends only on well-defined interfaces, making them independently testable.

### AJAX rendering (not inline)

The shortcode outputs a lightweight `<div>` placeholder; JavaScript loads the actual event list via AJAX. This means:

- Full-page caches (Varnish, WP Super Cache, LiteSpeed) still work correctly.
- Multiple shortcode instances on the same page each fire their own request independently.
- The nonce is injected via `wp_localize_script` so it's always fresh.

### WP Transient caching

Cache keys are deterministic `md5` hashes of `(calendar_id + count + days_ahead)`, so different shortcode configurations are cached independently. A **transient registry** option (`uce_transient_registry`) tracks all active keys so a single `flush_all()` call can purge everything without an expensive `LIKE` query on the options table.

### Input/output discipline

- Every value from `$_POST`, `$_GET`, and the API is sanitised on the way in (`sanitize_text_field`, `absint`, `wp_kses_post`).
- Every value emitted to HTML is escaped on the way out (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses_post`).
- All admin actions are protected by nonces and `current_user_can('manage_options')` checks.

---

## Bonus Items (Given More Time)

- **Gutenberg block** — register a block that wraps the same AJAX logic with a block editor panel for setting attributes.
- **Multiple calendars merged** — pass a comma-separated list of IDs; `EventFetcher` makes parallel requests, merges, and sorts by start time.
- **Event grouping by day** — add a `group_by_day` shortcode attribute; the `AjaxHandler` renderer groups events into `<section>` elements with `<h4>` date headings.
- **Frontend "load more"** — store a `pageToken` from the Google API response; a "Load more" button fires another AJAX request with the token appended.
- **Unit tests** — PHPUnit + WP_Mock for the `GoogleCalendarClient`, `TransientCache`, and `AjaxHandler` classes.

## AI Disclosure

Approximately **70%** of this code was written with AI assistance (Claude by Anthropic), used as a senior pair-programming partner. The AI generated first drafts of class skeletons, suggested the transient-registry flush approach, and wrote template HTML. I reviewed, corrected, and integrated all output — decisions around the AJAX architecture, the PSR-4 fallback autoloader, nonce/capability patterns, and the output escaping strategy were either mine or were verified against the WordPress Developer Handbook before committing.
